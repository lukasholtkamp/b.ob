<!-- Variables -->
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <h1>B.ob - Bertrandt office bot</h1>
<h2>Goal for 2023-06-19:<br></h2>
<strong>Control b.ob with the XBox to drive Forward, Backward and turn on point.</strong>

<h2>PASSED for 2023-06-05:<br></h2>
<strong>Have one wheel turning, controlled by XBox.</strong>
Wheel moves forwards when left thumbstick is moved forward, within specified boundaries of min and max speed.
Control was too sensitive which might be unsafe. There needs to be a limit, so that it does not run with small excitations. The emergency stop button needs to be installed.
  A way to remotely stop the b.ob should be considered.
